/*
 * TODO:
 * 
 *  - I think it would be better to ditch the `prev' array, and
 *    instead make the `dist' array strictly monotonic (by having
 *    each distance be something like I*A+S, where A is the grid
 *    area, I the number of INITIAL squares trampled on, and S the
 *    number of harmless spaces moved through). This would permit
 *    the path-tracing when a pull is actually made to choose
 *    randomly from all the possible shortest routes, which would
 *    be superior in terms of eliminating directional bias.
 *     + So when tracing the path back to the current px,py, we
 * 	 look at all four adjacent squares, find the minimum
 * 	 distance, check that it's _strictly smaller_ than that of
 * 	 the current square, and restrict our choice to precisely
 * 	 those squares with that minimum distance.
 *     + The other place `prev' is currently used is in the check
 * 	 for consistency of a pull. We would have to replace the
 * 	 check for whether prev[ny*w+nx]==oy*w+ox with a check that
 * 	 made sure there was at least one adjacent square with a
 * 	 smaller distance which _wasn't_ oy*w+ox. Then when we did
 * 	 the path-tracing we'd also have to take this special case
 * 	 into account.
 * 
 *  - More discriminating choice of pull. (Snigger.)
 *     + favour putting targets in clumps
 *     + try to shoot for a reasonably consistent number of barrels
 * 	 (adjust willingness to generate a new barrel depending on
 * 	 how many are already present)
 *     + adjust willingness to break new ground depending on how
 * 	 much is already broken
 * 
 *  - generation time parameters:
 *     + enable NetHack mode (and find a better place for the hole)
 *     + decide how many of the remaining Is should be walls
 * 
 *  - at the end of generation, randomly position the starting
 *    player coordinates, probably by (somehow) reusing the same
 *    bfs currently inside the loop.
 * 
 *  - possible backtracking?
 * 
 *  - IWBNI we could spot completely unreachable bits of level at
 *    the outside, and not bother drawing grid lines for them. The
 *    NH levels currently look a bit weird with grid lines on the
 *    outside of the boundary.

/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Game generation mechanism.
 * 
 * To generate a Sokoban level, we begin with a completely blank
 * grid and make valid inverse moves. Grid squares can be in a
 * number of states. The states are:
 * 
 *  - INITIAL: this square has not as yet been touched by any
 *    inverse move, which essentially means we haven't decided what
 *    it is yet.
 * 
 *  - SPACE: this square is a space.
 * 
 *  - TARGET: this square is a space which is also the target for a
 *    barrel.
 * 
 *  - BARREL: this square contains a barrel.
 * 
 *  - BARRELTARGET: this square contains a barrel _on_ a target.
 * 
 *  - WALL: this square is a wall.
 * 
 *  - PLAYER: this square contains the player.
 * 
 *  - PLAYERTARGET: this square contains the player on a target.
 * 
 * We begin with every square of the in state INITIAL, apart from a
 * solid ring of WALLs around the edge. We randomly position the
 * PLAYER somewhere. Thereafter our valid moves are:
 * 
 *  - to move the PLAYER in one direction _pulling_ a barrel after
 *    us. For this to work, we must have SPACE or INITIAL in the
 *    direction we're moving, and BARREL or BARRELTARGET in the
 *    direction we're moving away from. We leave SPACE or TARGET
 *    respectively in the vacated square.
 * 
 *  - to create a new barrel by transforming an INITIAL square into
 *    BARRELTARGET.
 * 
 *  - to move the PLAYER freely through SPACE and TARGET squares,
 *    leaving SPACE or TARGET where it started.
 * 
 *  - to move the player through INITIAL squares, carving a tunnel
 *    of SPACEs as it goes.
 * 
 * We try to avoid destroying INITIAL squares wherever possible (if
 * there's a path to where we want to be using only SPACE, then we
 * should always use that). At the end of generation, every square
 * still in state INITIAL is one which was not required at any
 * point during generation, which means we can randomly choose
 * whether to make it SPACE or WALL.
 * 
 * It's unclear as yet what the right strategy for wall placement
 * should be. Too few WALLs will yield many alternative solutions
 * to the puzzle, whereas too many might rule out so many
 * possibilities that the intended solution becomes obvious.
