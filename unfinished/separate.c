/*
 * separate.c: Implementation of `Block Puzzle', a Japanese-only
 * Nikoli puzzle seen at
 *   http://www.nikoli.co.jp/ja/puzzles/block_puzzle/
 * 
 * It's difficult to be absolutely sure of the rules since online
 * Japanese translators are so bad, but looking at the sample
 * puzzle it seems fairly clear that the rules of this one are
 * very simple. You have an mxn grid in which every square
 * contains a letter, there are k distinct letters with k dividing
 * mn, and every letter occurs the same number of times; your aim
 * is to find a partition of the grid into disjoint k-ominoes such
 * that each k-omino contains exactly one of each letter.
 * 
 * (It may be that Nikoli always have m,n,k equal to one another.
 * However, I don't see that that's critical to the puzzle; k|mn
 * is the only really important constraint, and even that could
 * probably be dispensed with if some squares were marked as
 * unused.)

/*
 * Current status: only the solver/generator is yet written, and
 * although working in principle it's _very_ slow. It generates
 * 5x5n5 or 6x6n4 readily enough, 6x6n6 with a bit of effort, and
 * 7x7n7 only with a serious strain. I haven't dared try it higher
 * than that yet.
 * 
 * One idea to speed it up is to implement more of the solver.
 * Ideas I've so far had include:
 * 
 *  - Generalise the deduction currently expressed as `an
 *    undersized chain with only one direction to extend must take
 *    it'. More generally, the deduction should say `if all the
 *    possible k-ominoes containing a given chain also contain
 *    square x, then mark square x as part of that k-omino'.
 *     + For example, consider this case:
 * 
 *         a ? b    This represents the top left of a board; the letters
 *         ? ? ?    a,b,c do not represent the letters used in the puzzle,
 *         c ? ?    but indicate that those three squares are known to be
 *                  of different ominoes. Now if k >= 4, we can immediately
 *         deduce that the square midway between b and c belongs to the
 *         same omino as a, because there is no way we can make a 4-or-
 *         more-omino containing a which does not also contain that square.
 *         (Most easily seen by imagining cutting that square out of the 
 *         grid; then, clearly, the omino containing a has only two
 *         squares to expand into, and needs at least three.)
 * 
 *    The key difficulty with this mode of reasoning is
 *    identifying such squares. I can't immediately think of a
 *    simple algorithm for finding them on a wholesale basis.
 * 
 *  - Bfs out from a chain looking for the letters it lacks. For
 *    example, in this situation (top three rows of a 7x7n7 grid):
 * 
 *        +-----------+-+
 *        |E-A-F-B-C D|D|
 *        +-------     ||
 *        |E-C-G-D G|G E|
 *        +-+---        |
 *        |E|E G A B F A|
 *
 *    In this situation we can be sure that the top left chain
 *    E-A-F-B-C does extend rightwards to the D, because there is
 *    no other D within reach of that chain. Note also that the
 *    bfs can skip squares which are known to belong to other
 *    ominoes than this one.
 * 
 *    (This deduction, I fear, should only be used in an
 *    emergency, because it relies on _all_ squares within range
 *    of the bfs having particular values and so using it during
 *    incremental generation rather nails down a lot of the grid.)
 * 
 * It's conceivable that another thing we could do would be to
 * increase the flexibility in the grid generator: instead of
 * nailing down the _value_ of any square depended on, merely nail
 * down its equivalence to other squares. Unfortunately this turns
 * the letter-selection phase of generation into a general graph
 * colouring problem (we must draw a graph with equivalence
 * classes of squares as the vertices, and an edge between any two
 * vertices representing equivalence classes which contain squares
 * that share an omino, and then k-colour the result) and hence
 * requires recursion, which bodes ill for something we're doing
 * that many times per generation.
 * 
 * I suppose a simple thing I could try would be tuning the retry
 * count, just in case it's set too high or too low for efficient
 * generation.
