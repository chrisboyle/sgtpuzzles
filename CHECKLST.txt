Things to remember when adding a new puzzle
-------------------------------------------

Write the source file for the new puzzle (duhh).

Create a .R file for it which:
 - defines a <puzzle>_EXTRA symbol for it if it requires auxiliary
   object files (make sure that symbol doesn't contain the icon)
 - adds it to the `ALL' definition, to ensure it is compiled into
   the OS X binary
 - adds it as a GTK build target, with the optional GTK icon
 - adds it as a Windows build target, with the optional resource
   file
 - adds auxiliary solver binaries if any
 - adds it to $(GAMES) in the GTK makefile, for `make install'
 - adds it to list.c for the OS X binary
 - adds it to wingames.lst along with a textual name, for the build
   system and Windows installer.

If the puzzle is by a new author, modify the copyright notice in
LICENCE and in puzzles.but. (Also in index.html, but that's listed
below under website changes.)

Double-check that the game structure name in the source file has
been renamed from `nullgame', so that it'll work on OS X. Actually
compiling it on OS X would be a good way to check this, if
convenient.

Add a documentation section in puzzles.but.

Make sure there's a Windows help topic name defined in puzzles.but,
and that it's referenced by the help topic field in the game
structure in the source file.

Check that REQUIRE_RBUTTON and/or REQUIRE_NUMPAD are set as
appropriate.

Add the new Unix binary name, and the names of any auxiliary solver
binaries, to the svn:ignore property.

Write an instructions fragment for the webified puzzle pages, as
html/<puzzlename>.html .

Make a screenshot:
 - create an appropriate save file in `icons'
 - add the puzzle name to icons/Makefile
 - set up a REDO property in icons/Makefile if the screenshot wants
   to display a move halfway through an animation
 - set up a CROP property in icons/Makefile if the icon wants to be
   a sub-rectangle of the whole screenshot

Don't forget to `svn add' the new source file, the new .R file and the
save file in `icons', the new .html file, and any other new files that
might have been involved.

Check in!

Put the puzzle on the web:
 - run puzzlesnap first
 - make sure the screenshot and Windows binary have arrived in the www
   directory, and that the .jar file and its accompanying web page has
   arrived in the java subdirectory
 - add an entry in the puzzles list in index.html
 - add the Windows executable name to the list further down
   index.html
 - adjust the copyright in index.html if the puzzle is by a new
   author
 - test that the binary link and the docs link work
 - test that the Java version works
 - run webupdate
 - test again
 - check in the change to index.html
