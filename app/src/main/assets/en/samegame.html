<h1><a name="C13"></a>Chapter 13: <a name="i0"></a>Same Game</h1>
<p>
You have a grid of coloured squares, which you have to clear by highlighting contiguous regions of more than one coloured square; the larger the region you highlight, the more points you get (and the faster you clear the arena).
</p>
<p>
If you clear the grid you win. If you end up with nothing but single squares (i.e., there are no more clickable regions left) you lose.
</p>
<p>
Removing a region causes the rest of the grid to shuffle up: blocks that are suspended will fall down (first), and then empty columns are filled from the right.

<h2><a name="S13.1"></a>13.1 <a name="i1"></a>Same Game controls</h2>
<p>
<em>On Android, please touch for left click and long press for right click. Also note that where this manual refers to pressing a letter on the keyboard, the Android version has icons at the bottom of the screen instead.</em>
</p>
<p>
This game can be played with either the keyboard or the mouse.
</p>
<p>
If you left-click an unselected region, it becomes selected (possibly clearing the current selection).
</p>
<p>
If you left-click the selected region, it will be removed (and the rest of the grid shuffled immediately).
</p>
<p>
If you right-click the selected region, it will be unselected.
</p>
<p>
The cursor keys move a cursor around the grid. Pressing the Space or Enter keys while the cursor is in an unselected region selects it; pressing Space or Enter again removes it as above.
</p>
<p>
(All the actions described in <a href="common.html#S2.1">section 2.1</a> are also available.)

<h2><a name="S13.2"></a>13.2 <a name="i2"></a>Same Game parameters</h2>
<p>
These parameters are available from the &#8216;Custom...&#8217; option on the &#8216;Type&#8217; menu.
</p>
<dl><dt>
<em>Width</em>, <em>Height</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Size of grid in squares.
</dd>
<dt>
<em>No. of colours</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Number of different colours used to fill the grid; the more colours, the fewer large regions of colour and thus the more difficult it is to successfully clear the grid.
</dd>
<dt>
<em>Scoring system</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Controls the precise mechanism used for scoring. With the default system, &#8216;(n-2)^2&#8217;, only regions of three squares or more will score any points at all. With the alternative &#8216;(n-1)^2&#8217; system, regions of two squares score a point each, and larger regions score relatively more points.
</dd>
<dt>
<em>Ensure solubility</em>
</dt>
<dd>
If this option is ticked (the default state), generated grids will be guaranteed to have at least one solution.
<p>
If you turn it off, the game generator will not try to guarantee soluble grids; it will, however, still ensure that there are at least 2 squares of each colour on the grid at the start (since a grid with exactly one square of a given colour is <em>definitely</em> insoluble). Grids generated with this option disabled may contain more large areas of contiguous colour, leading to opportunities for higher scores; they can also take less time to generate.
