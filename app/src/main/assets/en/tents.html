<h1><a name="C25"></a>Chapter 25: <a name="i0"></a>Tents</h1>
<p>
You have a grid of squares, some of which contain trees. Your aim is to place tents in some of the remaining squares, in such a way that the following conditions are met:
</p>
<ul><li>
There are exactly as many tents as trees.
</li>
<li>
The tents and trees can be matched up in such a way that each tent is directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally) to its own tree. However, a tent may be adjacent to other trees as well as its own.
</li>
<li>
No two tents are adjacent horizontally, vertically <em>or diagonally</em>.
</li>
<li>
The number of tents in each row, and in each column, matches the numbers given round the sides of the grid.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This puzzle can be found in several places on the Internet, and was brought to my attention by e-mail. I don't know who I should credit for inventing it.

<h2><a name="S25.1"></a>25.1 <a name="i1"></a>Tents controls</h2>
<p>
<em>On Android, please touch for left click and long press for right click. Also note that where this manual refers to pressing a letter on the keyboard, the Android version has icons at the bottom of the screen instead.</em>
</p>
<p>
Left-clicking in a blank square will place a tent in it. Right-clicking in a blank square will colour it green, indicating that you are sure it <em>isn't</em> a tent. Clicking either button in an occupied square will clear it.
</p>
<p>
If you <em>drag</em> with the right button along a row or column, every blank square in the region you cover will be turned green, and no other squares will be affected. (This is useful for clearing the remainder of a row once you have placed all its tents.)
</p>
<p>
You can also use the cursor keys to move around the grid. Pressing the return key over an empty square will place a tent, and pressing the space bar over an empty square will colour it green; either key will clear an occupied square.
</p>
<p>
(All the actions described in <a href="common.html#S2.1">section 2.1</a> are also available.)
