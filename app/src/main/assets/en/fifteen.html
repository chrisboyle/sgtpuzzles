<h1><a name="C5"></a>Chapter 5: <a name="i0"></a>Fifteen</h1>
<p>
The old ones are the best: this is the good old &#8216;<a name="i1"></a>15-puzzle&#8217; with sliding tiles. You have a 4&#215;4 square grid; 15 squares contain numbered tiles, and the sixteenth is empty. Your move is to choose a tile next to the empty space, and slide it into the space. The aim is to end up with the tiles in numerical order, with the space in the bottom right (so that the top row reads 1,2,3,4 and the bottom row reads 13,14,15,<em>space</em>).
</p>
<h2><a name="S5.1"></a>5.1 <a name="i2"></a>Fifteen controls</h2>
<p>
<em>On Android, please touch for left click and long press for right click. Also note that where this manual refers to pressing a letter on the keyboard, the Android version has icons at the bottom of the screen instead.</em>
</p>
<p>
This game can be controlled with the mouse or the keyboard.
</p>
<p>
A left-click with the mouse in the row or column containing the empty space will move as many tiles as necessary to move the space to the mouse pointer.
</p>
<p>
The arrow keys will move a tile adjacent to the space in the direction indicated (moving the space in the <em>opposite</em> direction).
</p>
<p>
(All the actions described in <a href="common.html#S2.1">section 2.1</a> are also available.)
</p>
<h2><a name="S5.2"></a>5.2 <a name="i3"></a>Fifteen parameters</h2>
<p>
The only options available from the &#8216;Custom...&#8217; option on the &#8216;Type&#8217; menu are <em>Width</em> and <em>Height</em>, which are self-explanatory. (Once you've changed these, it's not a &#8216;15-puzzle&#8217; any more, of course!)
