<h1><a name="C16"></a>Chapter 16: <a name="i0"></a>Pegs</h1>
<p>
A number of pegs are placed in holes on a board. You can remove a peg by jumping an adjacent peg over it (horizontally or vertically) to a vacant hole on the other side. Your aim is to remove all but one of the pegs initially present.
</p>
<p>
This game, best known as <a name="i1"></a>&#8216;Peg Solitaire&#8217;, is possibly one of the oldest puzzle games still commonly known.
</p>
<h2><a name="S16.1"></a>16.1 <a name="i2"></a>Pegs controls</h2>
<p>
<em>On Android, please touch for left click and long press for right click. Also note that where this manual refers to pressing a letter on the keyboard, the Android version has icons at the bottom of the screen instead.</em>
</p>
<p>
To move a peg, drag it with the mouse from its current position to its final position. If the final position is exactly two holes away from the initial position, is currently unoccupied by a peg, and there is a peg in the intervening square, the move will be permitted and the intervening peg will be removed.
</p>
<p>
Vacant spaces which you can move a peg into are marked with holes. A space with no peg and no hole is not available for moving at all: it is an obstacle which you must work around.
</p>
<p>
You can also use the cursor keys to move a position indicator around the board. Pressing the return key while over a peg, followed by a cursor key, will jump the peg in that direction (if that is a legal move).
</p>
<p>
(All the actions described in <a href="common.html#S2.1">section 2.1</a> are also available.)

Controls whether you are given a board of a standard shape or a randomly generated shape. The two standard shapes currently supported are &#8216;Cross&#8217; and &#8216;Octagon&#8217; (also commonly known as the English and European traditional board layouts respectively). Selecting &#8216;Random&#8217; will give you a different board shape every time (but always one that is known to have a solution).
