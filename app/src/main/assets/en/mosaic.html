<h1><a name="C12"></a>Chapter 42: <a name="i0"></a>Mosaic</h1>
<p>
The board is filled with clues, the clues tell you how many squares around the clue
are black, <b>including</b> the square of the clue itself, the total squares around
the clue are 9 in the middle of the board, 4 in the corners and 6 along the edge.
</p>
<p>
A click does a step in the circle of modes: unmarked -> marked -> blank.
</p>
<p>
A right click (or a long press on Android) does two steps instead of one. 
</p>
<p>
Drag is supported, vertically and horizontally (diagonally is not), sets all unmarked
tiles to the the first tile state (according to the button). Right drag might not work
on touchscreens and touchpads.
</p>
<p>
The puzzle is guaranteed to be solvable, using single clues alone (the advanced logic, which
works with more than one clue, is not implemented yet), the solution is not guaranteed to be
unique, but it's very likely is. Anyway, a correct solution is always accepted.

The game is also known as: ArtMosaico, Count and Darken, Cuenta Y Sombrea, Fill-a-Pix,
Fill-In, Komsu Karala, Magipic, Majipiku, Mosaico, Mosaik, Mozaiek, Nampre Puzzle, Nurie-Puzzle, Oekaki-Pix, Voisimage.
Implementation is loosely based on https://github.com/mordechaim/Mosaic
