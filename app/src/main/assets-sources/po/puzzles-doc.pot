"I wrote this collection because I thought there should be more small desktop "

"or vice versa; so I arranged that everything in my personal puzzle "
"collection will happily run on both, and have more recently done a port to "
"\\i{Mac OS X} as well. When I find (or perhaps invent) further puzzle games "
"that I like, they'll be added to this collection and will immediately be "
"available on both platforms. And if anyone feels like writing any other "
