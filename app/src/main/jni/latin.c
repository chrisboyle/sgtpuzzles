 * Look for forcing chains. A forcing chain is a path of

 *
 *  (b) Each pair of squares which are adjacent on the path share

 *
 *  (c) Each square in the middle of the path shares _both_ of its
 *      numbers with at least one of its neighbours (not the same
 *      one with both neighbours).
 *
 * These together imply that at least one of the possible number
 * choices at one end of the path forces _all_ the rest of the
 * numbers along the path. In order to make real use of this, we
 * need further properties:
 *
 *  (c) Ruling out some number N from the square at one end
 *      of the path forces the square at the other end to
 *      take number N.
 *
 *  (d) The two end squares are both in line with some third
 *      square.
 *
 *  (e) That third square currently has N as a possibility.
 *
 * If we can find all of that lot, we can deduce that at least one
 * of the two ends of the forcing chain has number N, and that
 * therefore the mutually adjacent third square does not.

 * To find forcing chains, we're going to start a bfs at each
