Welcome, translators!

One difference from other Android applications: most strings come from C and
may have percent-escapes for sprintf, like %s, %d, etc: you can't change the
order of percent-escapes.

If you're not familiar with translation on Android, here's how that works: This
file is res/values/strings.xml. A translator produces a new version of this
file, with the string names the same but the values different, and then I put
it at, let's say the translation is French, res/values-fr/strings.xml, and an
Android device will automatically try there first if the language is set to
French, falling back on res/values/strings.xml otherwise.

N.B. This will be migrated to po4a when I have the time (generating this file).

Thank you for volunteering. When you've finished, send this file to
chris@boyle.name and I'll be happy to include it in future versions.
