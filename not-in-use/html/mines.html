Mines
<p>
Try to expose every square in the grid that is not one of the hidden
mines, without opening any square that is a mine.
<p>
Click in a square to open it. Every opened square is marked with
the number of mines in the surrounding 8 squares, if there are any;
if not, all the surrounding squares are automatically opened.
<p>
Right-click in a square to mark it with a flag if you think it is a
mine. If a numbered square has exactly the right number of flags
around it, you can click in it to open all the squares around it
that are not flagged.
<p>
The first square you open is guaranteed to be safe, and (by default)
you are guaranteed to be able to solve the whole grid by deduction
rather than guesswork. (Deductions may require you to think about
the total number of mines.)
<p>
If you think you've found a grid which can't be solved without
guessing, <b>think harder!</b> Mines was written in 2005, and since it
was written, I've had over 50 reports claiming that a grid had two
solutions, or required guessing at a safe square to
open. <em>None</em> of those reports turned out to be a real bug in
the game generation.
